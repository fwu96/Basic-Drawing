Parts of the Assignment you did (or did not) do:

Did you do any bonus parts? page3 ex2 if that one is, and will try to do page5 ex2
Update: I did several tries for ex2 in page5, but still not figure it out. Now it seems the simplest demo. I push the demo back to see if there are any partical credits. I will work hard for the bouns parts of next assignment.

Notes to the Grader: For the ex2 in page3, that graphic is actually a logo of my favorite singer, which can find online by searching "hamasaki ayumi logo". Implementing this by canvas, I mostly use `quadraticCurveTo` function to implement those curves (althong the left and right are still not totally symmetric). Also I used `translation` and `scale` method to edit the shapes an the end. For the color I use `rgb` by adding the fourth parameter as transparency, and the red one in the front should look more intensive than other two in the back since its transparency value is higher than others.
